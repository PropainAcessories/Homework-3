🐔This is the third week of assignments from the coding boot camp.

🐔I had to write out arrays of options for the computer to choose from.

🐔I created a function to ask the user what they wanted to include in their
  passwords.

🐔I defined the generate password function to compile the selected options
    into a finished password

🐔I used conditional statements and for loops to execute the code.

🐔I compiled the end product with the math.floor and math.random methods
    inside a for loop at the end of the function for a properly randomized
    password.
